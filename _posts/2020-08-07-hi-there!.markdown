Hi There, my name is Tesar Wijaya. Just call me Tesar.

I’m a full-time software engineer working at one of fintech companies in Indonesia. I have about 4 years of experience in software engineering (at least when I write this post). I speak mainly in javascript and golang. I use a wide variety of tools in works such as reactjs, react native, express and so on so forth.

So I decided to start my blog today and share my view or idea about current technology or simply write a tutorial around javascript and golang.

And this is it. A short introduction about me.

Cheers!
